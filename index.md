# ACCESS RHIZOME  

This is the beginning of a long term project that I have decided to call the Access Rhizome. It orginally started as the Disability Drive, but as my research has evolved, my ideas about access have expanded far beyond the bounds of my own personal identity.  

This is a public collection of community knowledge that I have encountered during my professional and artistic development. The documents, photographs, presentations, and podcasts in the drive are mostly geared towards solving disability access problems on the ground, as opposed to waiting for a large institution to get around to passing legislation to address these issues. It's a DIY approach to solving and thinking about access in a much broader sense for disability, but many of these techniques and suggestions can be easily adapted for a workplace or any other institutional system concerned with equity.
